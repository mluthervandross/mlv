    Hi! I'm <a href="https://mluthervandross.github.io/mlv/" style="color:blue;" target="_blank">mluthervandross</a>! A master student in SJTU.
    
    <br><br>

    I enjoy developing efficient algorithms to solve challenging problems. I'm now dedicated in my research Image Compression based on deep learning, and of course, the next video coding codec, <a href="https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/VVCSoftware_VTM/-/tree/master" style="color:blue;" target="_blank">Versatile Video Coding codec.
    
    <br><br>

    Besides - <br>
    <ul>
        <li>focus on something interesting.</li>
        <li>reading the blog posts of cool tech companies and how they solved hard problems.</li>
        <li>writing my own blog posts on how I solved hard problems.
    </ul>
    
    <br><br>

    On days when I'm not writing code, you may find me somewhere else more stunningly and powerfully interesting aera!
